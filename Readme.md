# Price Prediction ML Strategy

This repository is a personal learning project focused on predicting financial prices using various machine learning techniques. The project explores and implements models such as:

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks)**
- **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**
- **CNN-MLP (Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Layer Perceptron)**

The goal is to experiment with and compare these approaches for time series forecasting and price prediction tasks. This project serves as a hands-on exploration of modern ML methods in quantitative finance.
